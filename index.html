          <p>Gaming PCs typically differ from mainstream personal computers by using high-performance video cards, a high core-count central processing units with raw performance and higher-performance RAM. Gaming PCs are also used for other demanding tasks such as video editing.In today's world, Game Theory is being extensively used in fields like economics, sociology, political science, etc. due to its versatile nature and applications in myriad of conflicts and problems. The application of game theory has been extended to computer science also due to its versatility and robustness.A personal computer is a computer small and low cost, which is intended for personal use (or for use by a small group of individuals). The term "personal computer" is used to describe desktop computers (desktops). It is often shortened to the acronym PC or microcomputer, whose meaning in English is "personal computer". It is a very common type of machines.


            Personal Computer (acronym PC) consists of a central processing unit (CPU) contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry on an single (IC) integrated circuit; two types of memory, main memory, such as RAM, and ROM, magnetic hard disks (HDD) and compact discs and various input/output devices, including a display screen, keyboard and mouse, modem, and printer.Prior to the Personal Computer (acronym PC), computers were designed for large organization who attached thin terminals for multiple users to a single large computer whose resources were shared among all users. The advent of the personal computer (PC), they break up the tradition of terminals computing. By the late 1980s, technology advances made it feasible to build a small computer that an individual could own and use.  </p>

                <dd>Intel Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. It is the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue,[3][4] and is one of the developers of the x86 series of instruction sets, the instruction sets found in most personal computers (PCs). Incorporated in Delaware,[5] Intel ranked No. 45 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue for nearly a decade, from 2007 to 2016 fiscal years.[6]

                    Intel supplies microprocessors for computer system manufacturers such as Acer, Lenovo, HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.
                    
                    Intel (integrated and electronics) was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Gordon Moore (of Moore's law) and Robert Noyce (1927–1990), and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove. Intel was a key component of the rise of Silicon Valley as a high-tech center. Noyce was a key inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip).[7][8] Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business.
                    
                    During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period, Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry.[9][10]
                    
                    The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP, and supports other open-source projects such as Wayland, Mesa, Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and Xen.[11]</dd>

                    The AMD processor runs on new 1331 pin AM4 socket motherboards shared by FX models in high-end systems as well as APU models. AM4 motherboards support DDR4 RAM, PCIe Gen3. Ryzen can function as a system on a chip for low-cost, bare-bones setups. AM4 offers other chipset-enabled features, such as additional PCIe slots, enhanced sound, SATA express, and USB 3.1 gen2 10Gbs connectivity. The shared socket also makes it easier to upgrade from base APU systems to discrete graphics cards along with FX CPUs for upgrades as well as those looking to at start entry level. Also of interest are claims of machine learning to predict instructions, making the CPU capable of learning how to run programs faster.

In launch demonstrations, un-boosted at 3.4Ghz, AMD Ryzen did slightly better than Intel’s 6900K 3.2-3.7Ghz with turbo enabled. Those stats equal performance with a $1100 Intel part. One historical disadvantage to AMD's competitiveness has been Intel’s manufacturing process lead. Using a smaller process has often given Intel’s processors the ability to run at higher speed. The launch of Ryzen represents the first time the two will be using the same process: 14 nm FinFET.
